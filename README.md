# CD-PSFs

This repository contains the scripts used to generate the results and figures reported in 'Environmental context alters plant-soil feedback effects on plant coexistence'. 

"General_Approach.R" - Script used to perform and visualize simulations used in Figure 1 of main text. 
"Proof-of-Concept.R" - Script used to perform and visualize simulations used in Figure 2 of main text. 
"Sensitivity_Analysis.R" - Script used to perform the sensitivity analyses reported in the main text as well as many that appear in Appendix S3
"partial_derivatives.nb" - Notebook used to calculate the partial derivatives of niche differences and fitness ratios with respect to species interaction parameters.
"Richness_Sensitivity.R" - Script used to compare sensitivity analysis results across a microbial species richness gradient (reported in Appendix S3)
"Garlic_Mustard_Simulations.R" - Script used to perform and visualized all of the invasive species simulations.
"Nonlinear_Scaling_Functions.R" - Script used to compare results from nonlinear scaling functions (reported in Appendix S1).
